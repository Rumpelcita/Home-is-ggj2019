# Home-is-ggj2019
"Home is…" is a short bitsy anthology made by Florencia Rumpel Rodriguez,Felipe N. Cassina, Julián Kopp, Nicolás Delfino, Leno, and Pablo F. Quarta for Global Game Jam 2019.

Homes have their own voices and personalities, each distinct and unique one from the other. With this in mind, each member of our team created a home for you to visit and explore, with its own story to tell. Walk within their walls, learn of the people who live there, and listen to what the homes have to say.
